# Pure plugins

Plugins are [WebAssembly components](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org)
run in a sandbox by [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev). The API is defined in
[`wit/helix-plugin.wit`](wit/helix-plugin.wit); any language that can build a
component for it works. Rust has an SDK in [`sdk/`](sdk).

## Using plugins

Each plugin is a directory in `~/.config/helix/plugins/` with a `plugin.toml`
and the component:

```
~/.config/helix/plugins/
└── text-tools/
    ├── plugin.toml
    └── plugin.wasm
```

Plugins are loaded at startup; `:plugin-reload` reloads them. Their commands run
with `:plugin-run <plugin>/<command> [args...]` (with completion) and can be
bound like any typable command:

```toml
# ~/.config/helix/config.toml
[keys.normal.space]
u = ":plugin-run text-tools/upper"
```

`:plugin-list` shows the loaded plugins, their permissions and commands, and
why a plugin was disabled.

Settings go in `~/.config/helix/plugins.toml`, one table per plugin. Everything
except `enabled` is passed to the plugin's `init` as JSON:

```toml
[text-tools]
enabled = false

[my-plugin]
width = 80
```

Try the example: copy [`examples/text-tools`](examples/text-tools) (its
`plugin.toml` and `plugin.wasm`) into `~/.config/helix/plugins/text-tools/`.

## Sandbox

- A plugin only gets the host functions for the **permissions** its manifest
  lists; anything else fails with "permission denied":
  - `read-buffers`: document text, paths, languages, selections
  - `edit-buffers`: change text and selections
  - `open-files`: open files
  - `run-commands`: run editor commands (only from the plugin's own commands)
- No file system, network, environment variables or standard streams (WASI is
  linked with nothing granted).
- Each call has a **time limit** (2 s for commands, 250 ms for event handlers,
  5 s for `init`) and plugins get at most **256 MiB** of memory. A plugin that
  runs out of time, out of memory or crashes is **disabled** (until
  `:plugin-reload`) and the editor keeps going.

## How calls work

When Pure calls a plugin (a command or an event) the plugin sees a snapshot
of the editor: open documents, their text, paths, languages and selections, the
focused document and the mode. Changes the plugin makes (edits, selections,
messages, opening files, commands) are collected and applied after the call
returns, in order. All edits of one call to a document are one undo step. Edits
are checked: they must be in bounds and not overlap, otherwise the call fails
and nothing is applied. Reads after an edit in the same call see the edit.

Positions are **char** offsets (not bytes), like everywhere in Pure. In
Pure a cursor is a one-char selection.

Events (`document-open`, `document-change`, `mode-switch`) are delivered
shortly after they happen; several changes to a document in a row (typing)
become one `document-change`. Edits a plugin makes don't trigger change events,
so a plugin reacting to changes can't loop forever.

## Writing a plugin in Rust

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo new --lib my-plugin
```

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
helix-plugin-api = { path = "/path/to/helix/helix-plugin/sdk" }
```

`src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use helix_plugin_api::{editor, register_plugin, CommandInfo, Edit, Plugin, Registration};

struct MyPlugin;

impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
    fn init(_config: String) -> Result<Registration, String> {
        Ok(Registration {
            commands: vec![CommandInfo {
                name: "hello".into(),
                doc: "Insert a greeting at the cursor".into(),
            }],
            events: vec![],
        })
    }

    fn run_command(name: &str, args: Vec<String>) -> Result<(), String> {
        match name {
            "hello" => {
                let doc = editor::current_document().ok_or("no document")?;
                let cursor = editor::selections(doc)?[0].head;
                let text = format!("hello {}", args.join(" "));
                editor::apply_edits(doc, &[Edit { from: cursor, to: cursor, text }])
            }
            _ => Err(format!("unknown command {name}")),
        }
    }
}

register_plugin!(MyPlugin);
```

`plugin.toml`:

```toml
name = "my-plugin"
version = "0.1.0"
api = "0.1"
description = "Says hello"
permissions = ["read-buffers", "edit-buffers"]
```

Build with `cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2` and copy
`target/wasm32-wasip2/release/my_plugin.wasm` to
`~/.config/helix/plugins/my-plugin/plugin.wasm` next to the manifest.

See [`examples/text-tools`](examples/text-tools) for a complete plugin and
[`tests/plugins/testplugin`](tests/plugins/testplugin) for every API function.

## Development

- `cargo test -p helix-plugin` tests the host with real plugins.
- `cargo test -p helix-term --features integration --test integration -- plugins`
  tests plugins in a running editor.
- `./build-plugins.sh` rebuilds the test plugin (`tests/fixtures`) and the
  example after changing them or the WIT file.
